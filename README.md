# Half-Life
The code for the HypotenuseLeg discord bot, it allows you to navigate channels and connect to them. Everything you send in the sending channel will then be sent through the bot into the receiving channel, and the other way around.
It is only meant for having fun between friends, do not use it for anything malicious.

Due to api changes, starting in 2022, a bot running Half Life will not be able to work in over 75 servers. I also have no plans at the moment to port Half Life to a different framework now that discord.py is no longer being developed.

# Before using:
1. Make a secrets.py file inside `bot/` following the given template in `secrets_template.py`
2. Review settings.py inside `bot/` and customize the bot
3. Once these are completed, your bot can be run can be run from the bot folder
